# Simple C++ Shell

A basic C++ program that acts as a simple shell, accepting commands like `mkdir`, `cp`, `ls`, `rm`, `cd`, `touch`, `echo`, `cat`, `mv`, `grep`, and executing them.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `myshell.cpp` file. Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ -o myshell myshell.cpp
   


   ./myshell
